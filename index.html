        <h1> Rogue Galaxy </h1>
        <img src="https://images.app.goo.gl/4th1se43Gb3aQCkx6" alt="a picture of Rogue Galaxy box art">
        <p>Level 5 have a history of creating distinctive titles that all have their own sense of identity whilst being
            very obviously a Level 5 game, this is partly due to the amount of polish that the graphics are given with a
            distinct cel shaded 2.5D look, an astounding soundtrack and well thought out gameplay mechanics it's hard to
            not love their work.
            Rogue Galaxy has found it's way to modern consoles as part of Sony's PS2 to PS4 promotion back in 2016 and
            I've only really gotten around to playing it recently! but so far, so good. The combat is fun even if I do
            generally prefer a slower paced JRPG instead of action RPG's it manages to capture the kind of charm that is
            often found within the Tales of series of games.
        </p>
        <p>As the game progresses you can venure across the galaxy in your own flying pirate ship....how cool is that?
            There are ton's of side missions and weapons to collect/forge and this all culminates in an experience that
            will last most players roughly 60 hours of game time but you can probably eek out another 20-40 hours
            depending on what kind of gamer you are. </p>
        <h1> Battle Garegga</h1>
        <p>Another clasic has been reincarnated and risen like the pheonix but with new, improved and shinier plummage!
            Battle Garegga has always been a legendery title that has filled those in the know with anxiety when they
            attempt to navigate it's harsh terrain but M2 have done a fine job of opening up the mysteries of this title
            and laying them out in plain site for players both old and new,
            this is thanks to the help of M2 gadgets which display a medley of important information over the sides of
            the screen whilst still preserving the arcade perfect dimensions of the screen. The action is fast and
            furious
            but since this is basically the first bullet hell game that kick started the genre it is slower than some of
            its predecessors.
            One of the biggest complaints of the arcade original is the colour of the bullets, since they were difficult
            to make out at times
            this has been addressed in this port and you can also change back to the original bullet colours if you
            really feel like squinting your way to victory!
        </p>
        <h1>Shiren The Wanderer 5+</h1>
        <p>The Shiren series has had a long history of difficult roguelike games going all the way back to the original
            Torneko No Daibouken by Chunsoft who have become
            more widely known for the Danganronpa series in recent years. Shiren 5+ is an enhanced version of the
            Nintendo DS/Playstation Vita game Shiren the Wanderer: The Tower of Fortune and the Dice of Fate, the
            original was a brilliant
            roguelike and with this enhanced version adding extra queality of life improvements such as an improved
            HUD(heads up display) it makes reading your situation
            easier than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game takes place across a series of biomes that work as randomly generated dungeons filled with
            different items and monsters, each item that you collect can
            either aid you or hinder you depending on what it is, with some items being cursed which means that you
            won't be able to unequip the item until the curse is lifted
            which can leave you in a precarious position! Items such as pots are really important in any run that
            extends past ten or more floors as they enable you to store items
            and keep food items safe which is incredibly important since you also have to manage your "Fullness" gauge
            or you will take damage with every single step/action, back to the pots!
            So pots come in many different shapes and sizes with varying affects such as being able to place items into
            a pot to acquire their value in Gitan the games currency or you can get a Hide pot
            which lets you climb inside of it to hide from enemies for a few turns, there are many more to discover and
            each one has their own use.
        </p>
        <p>
            items are also incredibly important and they range from healing herbs, food, staves and scrolls which can
            cast spells and of course shields and swords/weapons and bracers which have various effects. One of the most
            rewarding things to do in this series of games
            is to raise the level of a weapon or sheild and keep it from run to run which is harder than it sounds since
            as it is a roguelike game
            you lose everything upon death! which sounds like a huge deal but there are ways of mitigating this loss
            such as storing items in a warehouse/certain pots that will keep your items safe for you but you will still
            lose them if you aren't careful.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you enjoy challenging games that are strict but fair and don't let up on the difficulty then this title
            is for you,
            it embues a fantastic sense of gaining experience as a player through every single run which is such a
            rewarding feeling
            as you rarely make the same mistake twice! I have enjoyed this series ever since I played Torneko: The Last
            Hope on the Playstation One many years ago,
            I wish that I kept my copy of it after seeing the insane prices that it goes for nowadays but that's just
            how it goes, at least it lead me on to this fantastic series.
