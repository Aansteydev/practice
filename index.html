        <h1> Rogue Galaxy </h1>
        <p>Level 5 have a history of creating distinctive titles that all have their own sense of identity whilst being
            very obviously a Level 5 game, this is partly due to the amount of polish that the graphics are given with a
            distinct cel shaded 2.5D look, an astounding soundtrack and well thought out gameplay mechanics it's hard to
            not love their work.
            Rogue Galaxy has found it's way to modern consoles as part of Sony's PS2 to PS4 promotion back in 2016 and
            I've only really gotten around to playing it recently! but so far, so good. The combat is fun even if I do
            generally prefer a slower paced JRPG instead of action RPG's it manages to capture the kind of charm that is
            often found within the Tales of series of games.
        </p>
        <p>As the game progresses you can venure across the galaxy in your own flying pirate ship....how cool is that?
            There are ton's of side missions and weapons to collect/forge and this all culminates in an experience that
            will last most players roughly 60 hours of game time but you can probably eek out another 20-40 hours
            depending on what kind of gamer you are. </p>
        <h1> Battle Garegga</h1>
        <p>Another clasic has been reincarnated and risen like the pheonix but with new, improved and shinier plummage!
            Battle Garegga has always been a legendery title that has filled those in the know with anxiety when they
            attempt to navigate it's harsh terrain but M2 have done a fine job of opening up the mysteries of this title
            and laying them out in plain site for players both old and new,
            this is thanks to the help of M2 gadgets which display a medley of important information over the sides of
            the screen whilst still preserving the arcade perfect dimensions of the screen.
